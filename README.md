# Landing Page Project

This project is a multi-section landing page with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page. The project demonstrates JavaScript DOM manipulation to create interactive and user-friendly behavior.


## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:
- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the page.
- `js/app.js`: The main JavaScript file responsible for dynamic navigation, scroll behavior, and other interactive features.
- `css/style.css`: The CSS file for styling the landing page.

**Note**: The HTML and CSS templates were initially provided by Udacity Classroom, with modifications made to support the dynamic functionality implemented in JavaScript.


## Features:

- **Dynamic Navigation**: A navigation menu is built dynamically based on the number of sections on the page.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: When a navigation item is clicked, the page smoothly scrolls to the respective section.
- **Active Section Highlighting**: The section currently in view and its corresponding navigation link are highlighted as "active" while scrolling.
- **Hide Navigation on Inactivity**: The navigation bar hides automatically when the user is not scrolling and reappears when scrolling resumes.
- **Scroll to Top Button**: A scroll-to-top button appears when the user scrolls below the page, providing quick access back to the top of the page.

## Technologies Used :

- **JavaScript DOM Manipulation**: Key behaviors such as dynamic navigation, smooth scrolling, active state management, and show/hide functionality are implemented using JavaScript.
